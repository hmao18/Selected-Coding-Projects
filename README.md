# Selected-Coding-Projects
#### This repo contains some of my coding projects from classes in statistics, applied math, and data science at Rice University. Each project has a file for the raw code in R or MATLAB, as well as a PDF file to showing what the project was about. If the project was a homework, there is also another PDF for the homework question.
#### Codes from my computer science class (in Python) were written in an online platofrm that is internal to the school and I couldn't access anymore, so unfortunately I don't have any code file from that class to provide.
