# Selected-Coding-Projects
#### This repository contains some of my coding projects in the statistics, applied math, and data science classes during my undergraduate study at Rice University. Each project has a file for the raw code in R or MATLAB, as well as a PDF file showing what the project was about. If it was a team project, my teammates' names are on the PDF file. If it was a homework, there is also another PDF for the homework question. 
#### Codes from my computer science class (in Python) were written on a platofrm internal to the school and I can't access that anymore, so unfortunately I don't have any code file to provide from that class.
