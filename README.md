# Selected-Coding-Projects
## This repo contains some of my coding projects from classes in statistics, applied math, data science, and computer science at Rice University.
## Each project has a file for the raw code in R, Python, or MATLAB, as well as a PDF file to showing what the project was about. 
## If the project was a homework, there is also another PDF for the homework question.
